# hangman-word-game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that requires players to guess a secret word one letter at a time. Players use language and logic skills to guess letters. If the letter is in the word, it's revealed in the dashes. If not, a part of the hangman's body is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed or the hangman's body is fully drawn.
